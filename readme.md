# One More Pound

A simple Chrome extension that shifts all Markdown headings one level deeper (e.g. `#` → `##`, `##` → `###`) before you paste them into Notion, Obsidian or your markdown notes.

---

## Why?

When pasting AI responses into my notes, I noticed the Markdown headings (`# Intro`, `## Details`) were too “high-level” and messed up the structure of my existing notes. This extension fixes that by bumping all headings down one level.
